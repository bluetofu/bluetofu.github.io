You can play three of the oldest and most popular games right from the Google Search deck on your desktop or mobile browser: Pac-Man, Solitare and Tic-Tac-Toe.

Just search for "[pac man](http://www.google.com/search?q=pac+man){:rel="nofollow"}", "[solitaire](http://www.google.com/search?q=solitaire){:rel="nofollow"}" or "[tic tac toe](http://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe){:rel="nofollow"}" and you can quickly start the games.

These casual games in Google Search could be just the thing to overcome your boredom. Try them out for a round or two.

For some other fun tips, try asking Google, "[what sound does a pig make](http://www.google.com/search?q=what+sound+does+a+pig+make){:rel="nofollow"}?" Or if you're looking to settle a bet and feeling lucky, "[flip a coin](http://www.google.com/search?q=flip+a+coin){:rel="nofollow"}" may come in handy.
