[Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/){:rel="nofollow"} is the most popular Web browser, with more than 50 percent of the market. Here's my list of personal favourite free Chrome extensions you might be interested for potential Internet browsing.

*Note:* Browser extensions are useful but using too many extensions may slow down your browser. So, use only esstential extensions you need most.

#### 1. [Data Saver](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-saver/pfmgfdlgomnbgkofeojodiodmgpgmkac?hl=en){:rel="nofollow"}

If you're using Internet on a monthly basis data plan, then Google's Data Saver extension helps you to save some amount of bandwidth. By enabling this extension, Chrome will use Google servers to compress pages you visit before downloading them. But, due to privacy pages accessed using private connections (HTTPS) or in incognito tabs will not be optimised or seen by Google.

You can also enable Data Saver on Mobile Chrome on Android from the Settings menu.

#### 2. [Google Dictionary (by Google)](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en){:rel="nofollow"}

On a webpage, if you double click on any word this extension will help you to see its complete definition displayed in a bubble. This extension supports multiple languages and also can translate a foreign word to your default language.

#### 3. [Google Input Tools](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-input-tools/mclkkofklkfljcocdinagocijmpgbhab?hl=en){:rel="nofollow"}

By installing this extension, you can switch to typing in a different language with the click of the mouse, and switch back just as easily.

#### 4. [Google Translate](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb?hl=en){:rel="nofollow"}

This extension will help you to translate to your language by highlighting or right-clicking on a section of text and clicking on Translate icon next to it. Or, you can also translate the entire page you're visiting, by clicking the translate icon on the browser toolbar.

#### 5. [HTTPS Everywhere](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/http-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en){:rel="nofollow"}

It automatically makes websites use the more secure HTTPS connection instead of HTTP, if they support it. It will protect you against many forms of surveillance and account hijacking, and some forms of censorship.
