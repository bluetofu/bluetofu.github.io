Hello, my name is Wootaek Oh (오우택) and I'm a Data Scientist at [Devsisters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devsisters) in Seoul, Korea who loves searching into the ocean of data for insights, and surfing on the wave for the moment.

### Data

As smart phones become prevalent and computer networks have intensified, I wondered where all the logs, data generated from all sorts of electric devices, would go. I could not stop thinking that there must be a value to all the logs if we could read between those numbers.

After being discharged from the army, I switched my major from sociology to statistics to learn to read between the numbers. I chose sociology as a freshman because I was always curious about the reasons behind various social phenomena, but then I felt statistics, or the numbers, would provide more objective and precise reasons in explaining the events taking place around us.

After garnering enough experiences, I hope to start my own business which captures the most challenging problems we face today and turn hard data into useful insights and compelling stories to answer the problems.

### Surfing

My name Wootaek means rain and pond. My parents gave me this name after the fortune teller told that I'm in short of water. Believe it or not, I always lived close to the sea (except for college years) and I feel really comfortable in the ocean maybe because of my name.  

I first learned to surf in Busan, hometown to my parents, where I realized surfing was my meant-to-be activity. I'm looking forward to surfing near LA this summer and in Bali later in this year.
